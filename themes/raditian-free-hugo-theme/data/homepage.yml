  subtitle: "Sinology Alumni Network"
  description: "SAN (Sinological Alumni Network) has been established in 2007 by graduates and research associates of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.phil.uni-wuerzburg.de/sinologie/startseite/'>the University of Würzburg's Institute of East and South Asian Cultural Studies (Chinese Studies)</a>in order to remain in contact and facilitate communication among former students of the Sinology Department. In addition SAN has been used to recruit speakers for the yearly Post-Graduation Perspectives lecture, during which former students present their career paths and talk about their experiences post-graduation. What had been set up as a forum before, has now received a major makeup, shifting towards a simple website that contains information on the network as well as a possibility to sign up for membership and a newsletter. It is our goal to keep you updated about current and future developments, events, and job opportunities in the field of sinology. No matter what kind of degree in sinology (B. A. / M. Sc / M. A.) and specific field of interest you have got, feel free to sign up below. <p>SAN (汉学校友网)是由维尔茨堡大学东亚和南亚文化研究所（中国研究方向）的毕业生和研究人员于2007年建立，促进汉学系毕业生间的交流论坛。此外，SAN还被用来为每年的毕业展望讲座招募演讲者，在讲座中，以前的学生介绍他们的职业规划并讲述毕业后的经历。现在我们将之前的论坛进行了改造，转向了一个包含了网络基本信息，同时也可以注册会员获得实习通讯的简洁网页。访问SAN了解汉学领域当前和未来的发展，及时掌握当前活动，寻找工作机会，获得个人成长、终身发展。无论你在汉学领域有什么样的学位（学士/理学硕士/文学硕士），无论你对哪块专业领域感兴趣，都可以在下面注册。</p>"

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
