You might want to take care of installing Hugo first https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/.
Go to this project's root folder in your terminal and type "hugo server -D".
If done correctly you should be able to see a demonstration of how our Website is
going to look like in its current state at http://localhost:1313/.
This is just for the sake of testing your installation.
Notes:
4 folder are missing because they are empty. 
If you plan to add something to these folders just add the folders.
Missing folders as of now are: content, data, layouts and static.
GitHub doesnt include empty folders, so that's that.
If you were to add these folders with contents, the test stated 
above might not work anymore.
