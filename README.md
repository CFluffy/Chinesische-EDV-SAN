Notes: 4 folder are missing because they are empty if you plan to add something to these folders
just add them.
Missing folders as of now are: content, data, layouts and static.
GitHub doesnt include empty folders, so that's that.
If you were to add these folders with contents the test stated 
below might not work anymore. 
Go to this project's root folder in your terminal and type "hugo server -D".
If done correctly you should be able to see a demonstration of how our Website is
going to look like in its current state at http://localhost:1313/.
This is just for the sake of testing your installation.
